  Democratic, self governing forum software.
</p>

---

For my Computer Science coursework project, I intend to create a **self governing, democratic** alternative to the forum site [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) called **Corum**. 
Also, instead of being developed for the purpose of hosting the site for a single company like Reddit is, it will be aimed at those who want to host their own forum under their own domain, similar to solutions such as [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/), [MyBB](https://mybb.com/) etc. 
However, unlike these solutions, Corum will be built upon modern technologies and ideas. The details of these technologies can be found in the [Software Requirements and technologies](#software-requirements-and-technologies) section.

## The Idea

### A Self Governing Democracy
The idea of having self governing forum software means that the role of forum moderators doesn't need to exist. 
This is a good thing because:
* It means that the forum require less maintenance. (Less man power required)
* The users of the forum are responsible for maintaining it. (More **neutral** and **fair**)
* The removal of the moderator role keeps code complexity down. (Only 1 type of user account needs to exist)

### A Modern Codebase

## The Investigation

### Focus Groups (The End User)
- Two possible types of end users
  - The possible forum admin looking for new forum software
  - The end user of individual forums

### Interviews
- Reason for interviewing people (What kind of people as well)
- List of Questions that could have been asked
- List of answers (3/4 for each question)

### Research into Existing Systems
stub

### Observations

### Computational Methods Required
List given by Maria (Add more as seen fit)
- Decomposition
- Abstraction
- Complex calculations
- Pattern matching
- Sorting and searching
- Thinking procedurally
- Needs to analyse large amounts of data to find patterns in it (data mining)
- Needs large storage that needs to be accessed quickly
- Uses backtracking (going back in a program to find an alternative solution
- Uses Heuristics
- Uses visualization to solve problems.
- Needs to process data in real time.
- Use of divide and conquer.
