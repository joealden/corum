# Initial Project Idea

For my Computer Science coursework project, I intend to create an open and modern alternative to the forum-like website Reddit.
As an advocate for free and open source software, I believe that for a site so influential and popular as Reddit, both the management and development of it should be done in the open to keep the platform fair and neutral.
This is currently not the case. Reddit is privately owned, and the development process is kept behind closed doors. This could allow for biased agendas (political, fiscal etc.) to steer the direction that Reddit takes, at the expense of its users. It also allows for easier breaches of its user privacy (unnecessary tracking)
