# Initial Project Idea - Corum

For my Computer Science coursework project, I intend to create a **self governing, democratic** alternative to the forum website Reddit called **Corum**. 
Also, Instead of being developed for the purpose of hosting the site myself like Reddit is, it will also be aimed at those that which to host their own forums under their own domain, similar to solutions such as phpBB, myBB etc. However, unlike solutions like phpBB and the like, Corum will be built upon modern technologies and ideas. The details of these technologies can be found [here]().

## A Self Governing Democracy
The idea of having self governing forum software means that the role of forum moderators doesn't need to exist. This is a good thing because:

* It means that the forum require less maintenance. (Less man power required)
* The users of the forum are responsible for maintaining it. (More **neutral** and **fair**)
* The removal of the moderator role keeps code complexity down. (Only 1 type of user account needs to exist)
